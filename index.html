    <p>I am a communications designer with an emphasis on process. I am able to learn new technologies quickly and love to expand my toolset. My experience in the US Marine Corps has given me the ability to work under pressure and complete projects on time. I am self-possessed, efficient, meticulous, and show extreme attention to detail. I take pride in my work and will always strive to improve the level of engagement and effectiveness my projects bestow. If I’m not at school or work, I’m either telling my cat to get off the table, drinking tea with my wife, or playing video games.</p>
